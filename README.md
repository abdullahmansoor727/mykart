## Creative Attitude Associates

A simple e-commerce website I developed while taking a course for front-end Web Development and Web Designing from <a href="https://www.theearningacademy.com/">The Earning Academy Pakistan</a>.
It was created as the final course assignment.

This website is also mobile responsive for a better experience on mobile devices.

This assignment tested all our HTML, CSS and JS concepts and proved to be a crucial learning experience for me and enabled me to work further in this field as a freelance Web Developer on frameworks such as ASP.Net MVC and the MERN stack (mainly front-end on ReactJS).
